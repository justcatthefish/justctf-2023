### Welcome in my house
May the Force be with you.

```
nc house.nc.jctf.pro 1337
```

Note: do not focus on run.sh, nsjail.cfg or the Dockerfile: those are there to host and jail/sandbox the challenge properly.
Note2: If you get a `Couldn't initialize cgroup 2 user namespace for pid=...` in container logs, you lack cgroups v2 - you can mitigate this by commenting out `use_cgroupv2`, `group_pids_max`, `cgroup_mem_max`, `cgroup_cpu_ms_per_sec` lines in `nsjail.cfg`.
