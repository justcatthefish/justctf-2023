I am excited to announce that I have finally created my very own personal blog! However, I must confess that I was feeling a little lazy, so instead of building everything from scratch, I decided to use some existing blogs from past CTF challenges (hugeblog and miniblog#). Some patching was done to their security vulnerabilities to ensure that my blog is completely secure.

*Note: It is recommended to run local server, after you read the dummy flag try the __same__ solution on remote.*
