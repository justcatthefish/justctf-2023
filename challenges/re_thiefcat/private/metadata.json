    "description": "My friend told me they made a terminal based game, but using some issue with stock netcat as an excuse they sent me this netcat-like binary telling me to use it instead! I didn't get the source code, but I took a quick look at it using a well-known state-of-the-art reverse engineering tool and it seemed perfectly safe to run. However, it stole the flag for this task from me! Can you get it back?\n\nI recorded the network traffic and reconstructed a simple server in Python from it. The program was confirmed to run in a ubuntu:20.04 container, but it should run on almost any Linux distro out there.",
