We didn't get to see a Grand Prix in Italy, but fortunately we got our hands on a telemetry file from another race.

Can you find the flag?

Flag format is `justCTF{[a-zA-Z0-9_]+}`

Use `nc formula.nc.jctf.pro 1337` to test the encoding

* Hint1: L stands for Last
* Hint2: There is a bit in every lap
* Hint3: To stay at the top sometimes you need to change your tires.
